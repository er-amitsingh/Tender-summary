# Tender-summary
Tender-summary is a Python tool that automates the extraction of key information from tender PDFs and generates a structured JSON summary for quick review. It uses pdfplumber for text extraction, regex and spaCy for field detection, and Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers for AI-powered summarization. The tool parses important details such as the tender title, reference number, organization name, bid submission dates, and bid opening date, along with providing a short machine-generated summary of the document content.

The project is designed to handle large documents efficiently, using progress indicators for better user experience and text chunking to produce accurate summaries. Planned enhancements include OCR support for scanned tenders, additional field extraction such as tender value, location, contact details, EMD, and procurement method, as well as confidence scoring to improve trust in the extracted data. Future iterations aim to support multilingual tenders, batch processing of multiple PDFs, and interactive dashboards using Streamlit or Gradio.

For scalability, the tool can be extended into a REST API using FastAPI or Flask and integrated with databases for storing parsed tenders, enabling search and analytics capabilities. This makes Tender-summary an excellent starting point for organizations and developers looking to build automated procurement intelligence systems.
